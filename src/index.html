          <h1>Refugees in Washington State</h1>
          <p>
            Over the past 40 years, refugees to Washington state have arrived from countries around the world experiencing conflict. During the post-Vietnam War years through the 1980s, most refugees came from Southeast Asia. The collapse of the Soviet Union led to a mass exodus of refugees throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. In recent years, more are seeking refuge from violence in Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia.
